# Legacy VB.NET Code

This directory contains the original VB.NET/WPF implementation of the Space Haven Save Game Editor.

## Contents

- **VB.NET source files** (`.vb`) - Original application logic
- **XAML files** (`.xaml`) - WPF UI definitions
- **Project files** (`.vbproj`, `.sln`) - Visual Studio project configuration
- **Themes** - Material Design theme files
- **Images** (`.png`) - Application icons and images

## Status

This code has been replaced by the cross-platform Python/PySide6 implementation in the `crossplatform/` directory. The VB.NET code is kept here for reference purposes only.

## Note

The VB.NET implementation was Windows-only. The new cross-platform implementation provides the same functionality and works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
